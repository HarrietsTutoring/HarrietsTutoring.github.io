I’m Glasgow born & raised with an Edinburgh education - majoring in maths & physics. I live in Hamilton giving me easy access to the entire Scottish central belt.

I’ve always loved helping others learn, so after college I started teaching high school math in Williamwood secondary school. I soon learned that although I loved teaching, being in front of a classroom all day exhausted my introverted self. 

The next logical step was then to set up my own tutoring company to help those who truly wanted the help the most and those who, like myself, thrived outside the classroom.

I’ve fallen in love with helping students across the country from the convenience of their own homes. I love working with my students one-on-one to help them understand math a little bit better each day and to watch their confidence in themselves grow. I’m so grateful to do what I love.


##My credentials:

-BSc(Hons) in Mathematics & Physics, University of Edinburgh         
-5 years of experience tutoring well over 100 students            
-GRE Quantitative: 170 (GRE Verbal: 164) 99th percentile
